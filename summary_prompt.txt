Below is a revised, English-only prompt you can use. It preserves your original instructions (sections, length rules, keyword requirement) but forces the model to return a single valid JSON object in the exact structure you want—no extra text.

You are an expert research summarizer. Read the full text/paper that follows after the delimiter "—". Your task is to produce a single, valid JSON object and nothing else (no prose outside JSON, no markdown fences). Use English only.

Strict requirements:
	1.	Select exactly five key keywords from the paper and naturally weave them throughout all written fields (do not output a separate keywords field).
	2.	Fill all sections and obey length constraints precisely:
	•	overall_summary: 4–5 sentences.
	•	result: ≤ 200 characters (including spaces and punctuation).
	3.	Base everything strictly on the provided text. Do not invent facts. If a detail is missing, write "Not reported."
	4.	JSON must be valid (UTF-8, double quotes for keys/strings, no trailing commas). Use only the fields below in this order.

Output JSON schema (structure and formatting must match exactly):
```
{
"id": "<use the provided identifier for the input (e.g., the markdown filename like ‘PMC3177255.md’ or a PMCID if that is the only identifier)>",
"overall_summary": "<4–5 sentences summarizing purpose, background, and key contributions. Integrate the five selected keywords naturally.>",
"methods": [
"i) Experimental Data: <brief description of the data used; integrate relevant keywords>",
"ii) Experimental Techniques: <techniques applied; integrate relevant keywords>",
"iii) Experimental Conditions: <species, environment, treatments; integrate relevant keywords>",
"iv) Experimental Models: <models used; integrate relevant keywords>"
],
"result": "<≤200 characters summarizing the main experimental findings and conclusions; integrate at least one keyword>"
}
```

Additional rules:
	•	The methods array should contain the four entries above, in order, with the exact "i) … iv)" labels. If an item is truly not applicable, replace that entry’s description with "Not applicable."
	•	Do not add, remove, or rename any top-level fields.
	•	Do not include explanations, headers, or backticks outside the JSON.

The full text of the paper is as follows.
